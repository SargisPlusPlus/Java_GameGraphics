# Java_GameGraphics
A game written in Java. In this simple game, I have used Java graphics in order to create a canvas where smileys race each other. The speeds are determined at random and each time the game is launched, there will be a different winner every game. The game does not require user input. 
The program was written using Eclipse. To run the program, simply download the folder and import it to Eclipse.
